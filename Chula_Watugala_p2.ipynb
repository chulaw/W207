    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "a. K-Nearest Neighbor classifier is too simple to be able to handle a high number of features (25k+). This makes it difficult to classify a nearest neighbor accurately.\n",
    "b. Logistic Regression is not ideal when the number of features is significantly higher than the training data since this tends to result in overfitting. Naive Bayes does not have this issue.\n",
    "c. The higher the C, the effect of regularization is lower and so large weights are not penalized as severly. Therefore as C increases, the sum of squared weights increases."

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
